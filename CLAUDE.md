# AI Amen

A tongue-in-cheek art project / satirical web app about outsourcing spiritual disciplines to agentic AI.

## What this is

A single-page static site hosted on GitHub Pages at ai-amen.com. The humor comes from treating prayer, fasting, confession, and Bible study as SaaS features — the more seriously it's presented, the funnier it is.

## Stack

- Single `index.html` file with inline CSS and JS
- No build tools, no frameworks, no dependencies
- Google Fonts (Inter + Playfair Display)
- Hosted via GitHub Pages with custom domain

## Deployment

Push to `main` — GitHub Pages deploys automatically. The `CNAME` file maps to `ai-amen.com`.

## Key files

- `index.html` — the entire site
- `CNAME` — custom domain config for GitHub Pages
- `og.png` / `og.svg` — Open Graph image for link previews

## Tone

Deadpan. The comedy is in the contrast between polished tech presentation and absurd spiritual automation content. Never wink at the audience — play it straight.
